# *Problem Statement*
Managing daily expenses manually can be difficult and unorganized. People often forget their spendings or miscalculate totals, leading to poor financial planning. The lack of a simple and quick system to record and track expenses creates the need for a lightweight solution.  
The Expense Tracker program solves this by allowing users to add expenses, categorize them, view all entries, and calculate total spending easily through a command-line interface.
